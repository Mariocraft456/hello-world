# hello-world
Im new and have some ideas for hacks of Sonic the hedgehog 1. I'm young and will work cooperativly, especially since I don't have a computer besides the one I have for school, which is a Chromebook. The reason Chromebooks are crappy is because there worse than Windows XP. They can't even run .exe files. The most they can do is open a zipped folder without extracting it.
